        <p>Sorry, Data. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh,
            Data? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Talk about going nowhere fast. I recommend you don't fire
            until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Shields up!
            Rrrrred alert! The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores,
            cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. When has justice ever
            been as simple as a rule book? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how
            you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? In all trust, there is the
            possibility for betrayal. Travel time to the nearest starbase?</p>
