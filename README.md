# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A basic portfolio, but built using bootstrap's css framework.

Using bootstrap is significantly faster than using my own css, at least at my current knowledge and skill level. Creating and using my own css provides higher customization options and the complete capability to create responsive pages.  However, bootstrap makes it much easier to implement.

In conclusion, Bootstrap has its benefits, but it is no substitution for a basic understanding of html and css, particularly floats and flex.
